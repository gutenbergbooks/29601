<h1><big><i>SEE?</i></big></h1>

<h2><small>By EDWARD G. ROBLES, JR.</small></h2>

<div class="bk1"><i><b><big><span class="sp1">Seeing things? Don't go to an</span><br />
analyst&mdash;see the Commission&mdash;<br />
<span class="sp2">if it doesn't find you first!</span></big></b></i></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Well</span>, there was this
song a few years back.
You know the one. Phil
Harris singing about a thing that
you couldn't get rid of, no matter
what you did, a thing so repulsive
it made you a social outcast.
Never thought I'd see one,
though. Dirty Pete found it.</p>

<p>Don't rush me. I'll tell you
about it.</p>

<p>We're hobos, understand? Now
a hobo is a different breed of cat
than you think. Oh, people are
getting educated to the idea that
a hobo will work and move on,
whereas a tramp will mooch and
move on, and a bum will mooch
and hang around, but you still
find folks who are ignorant
enough to call us bums.</p>

<p>We're aristocrats, yes sir. If
it wasn't for us, you wouldn't
enjoy half the little luxuries you
do. Oh, don't believe me&mdash;talk to
your experts. They know that,
without the migratory worker,
most of the crops wouldn't get
harvested. And, if I talk highfalutin'
once in a while, don't
blame me. Associating with the
Professor improves any man's
vocabulary, in spite of themselves.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There</span> was the four of us,
see? We'd been kicking
around together for longer than
I care to think about. There was
the Professor and Dirty Pete and
Sacks and Eddie. I'm Eddie.
Nicknames are funny things.
Take the Professor&mdash;he was a
real professor once, until he began
hitting the bottle. Well, he
lost his job, his home, his family,
and his rep.</p>

<p>One morning, he wakes up on
Skid Row without a nickel in his
jeans and the great-granddaddy
of all hangovers. He comes to a
decision. Either he could make
a man out of hisself, or he could
die. Right then, dying looked like
the easiest thing to do, but it
took more guts that he had to
jump off a bridge, so he went on
the Road instead.</p>

<p>After he got over his shakes&mdash;and
he sure had 'em bad&mdash;he
decided that, if he never took
another drink, it'd be the best
thing for him. So he didn't. He
had a kind of dignity, though,
and he could really talk, so he
and I teamed up during the wheat
harvest in South Dakota. We
made all the stops and, when
we hit the peaches in California
we picked up Sacks and Dirty
Pete.</p>

<p>Sacks got his monicker because
he never wore shoes. He claimed
that gunny-sacks, wrapped
around his feet and shins, gave
as much protection and more
freedom, and they were more
comfortable, besides costing nix.
Since we mostly bought our shoes
at the dumps, at four bits a pair,
you might say he was stretching
a point, but that's one of the
laws of the Road. You don't step
on the other guy's corns, and he
don't step on yours.</p>

<p>So guess why Dirty Pete was
called that. Yeah. He hadn't
taken a bath since 'forty-six,
when he got out of the army, and
he didn't figure on ever takin'
another. He was a damn' good
worker, though, and nobody'd
ever try anything with him
around. He wasn't any bigger
than a Mack truck. Besides, he
was quiet.</p>

<p>Oh, sure. You wanna know
why I'm on the Road. Well, it
happens I like whiskers. Trouble
is, they're not fashionable, unless
you're some kind of an artist,
which I'm not. You know, social
disapproval. I didn't have the
guts to face it, so I lit out. Nobody
cares on the Road what
you do, so I was okay with my
belt-length beard.</p>

<p>A beard's an enjoyable thing,
too. There's a certain kind of
thrill you get from stroking it,
and feeling its silkiness run
through your fingers. And besides,
combing it, and keeping it
free of burrs, snarls and tangles,
sort of keeps your spare moments
so full that the devil don't find
any idle time to put your hands
to work in. If you ask me, I
think that the razor has been the
downfall of society. And I'm willing
to bet I have plenty of company
with the same opinion.</p>

<p>Show me a man who doesn't let
his beard grow once in a while,
even if it's only for a day or so,
and you've shown me a man who
thinks more of social pressure
than he does of his own comfort.
And show me a man who says
he likes to shave, and you've
shown me a man who is either a
liar or is asking for punishment.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">That's</span> enough about us. Now
to get on with the story. You
know, if the Professor hadn't been
around, there would probably
have been murder done over the
Thing, or at least our little group
would've split up, 'cause none of
us had the brains to figure it out.</p>

<p>Pete's an expert scrounger. His
eyes are sharp, and he's always
on the lookout for a salable piece
of goods, even if he can only get
a nickel for it. One night, we're
sitting in a jungle near Sacramento,
trying to figure out whether
to go north for the grapes,
or south for the grapes. They're
all over California, you know,
and they pay pretty well.</p>

<p>Pete, as usual, is out looking,
and pretty soon he comes back
into camp with this thing in his
hand. He handles it like it was
hot, but he's pleased he's found
it, because he hopes to merchandise
it. So he walks up to me, and
says, "Hey, Eddie. What'll you
gimme for this, huh?"</p>

<p>I say, "Get that to hell away
from me! I'll give you a swift
kick in the pants if you don't."</p>

<p>He looks real surprised. He
says, "Huh, I thought maybe you
could use it."</p>

<p>I get up on my feet. I say, real
low and careful, because maybe
he's joking, "Look, Pete&mdash;you
oughtta know by this time, I <i>like</i>
my beard. Now will you go
away?"</p>

<p>He mooches off, looking like
I'd kicked him, and goes over
to the Professor. I figure maybe
the Professor could use it, so I
listen. The Prof looks like he was
being offered a live rattlesnake.</p>

<p>"No, thanks, really, Pete. I
have resolved never to touch it
again. I hope you don't mind."</p>

<p>Well, for some reason Pete
don't look pleased, and he's real
unhappy by this time, but he
tries again.</p>

<p>"Hey, Sacks, what'll you gimme
for&mdash;"</p>

<p>He don't get a chance to finish.
I'm only listening with half an
ear, but I'm so surprised I stand
up like I been stuck with a pin.
Sacks says, "Whatinell would I
do with a left shoe? You know I
don't use 'em."</p>

<p>Pete looks at the thing in his
hand, and the Prof and I go over
there.</p>

<p>The Professor looks at the
thing real carefully and speaks
up. "Say, Pete, look at that thing
and tell me what it is."</p>

<p>"Why, it's a brand new bar of
soap, of course. I don't use it,
but one of you might want to.
What's all the beef about?"</p>

<p>"Soap?" I say. "Why, you poor
fish, something must have happened
to your eyes. When you
offered me that straight razor, I
thought you'd gone off your nut.
Now I <i>know</i> it."</p>

<p>The Professor interrupts. He
looks excited. "Wait a minute,
Eddie. To me that item looks exactly
like a full fifth of Old Harvester,
100 proof. Used to be my
favorite, before I became an abstainer.
To Pete, it looks like soap.
To you, it looks like a straight
razor while, to Sacks, it resembles
a shoe. Does that give you any
ideas?"</p>

<p>"Means we're all having hallucinations,"
I grunts.</p>

<p>"Exactly. Pete, was there anything
else in the location where
you found this thing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but some scrap tin."</p>

<p>"Show us."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">So</span>, the four of us wanders
across the field and, sure
enough, there was this silly-looking
object lying there. It was
about eighteen or twenty feet
across, and two feet thick, and I
nearly made a fool of myself. I
almost screamed when I saw six
straight razors <i>crawling</i> out of
a hole in its side.</p>

<p>The Professor whistled. "Grab
them, boys. We want them."</p>

<p>Well, Sacks sacrifices one of his
sacks, and we rounded up fifteen
of the useless things. We went
back to the jungle, where the Prof
explained it.</p>

<p>"Look, fellows, suppose you
were a being from another planet
that wanted to take over here.
Suppose, further, that you were
rather small and relatively defenseless.
To finish the suppositions,
suppose you were a positive
telepath, with not only the
ability to read minds, but also the
ability to create visual and tactile
hallucinations. How would you
protect yourself?"</p>

<p>A light began to dawn, but I
didn't say a word about it.</p>

<p>The Professor continued. "If
you could do all this, you'd make
yourself look just as useless as
possible. To Pete, you'd look like
a bar of soap, because he never
uses the stuff. To Sacks, you'd
look like a shoe, because his dislike
for shoes is evident in his
mind. To Eddie, who is proud of
his beard, you'd look like a razor,
while to me, you'd look like a bottle
of booze, because I dislike its
effects intensely. In other words,
you would assume an imposture
that would assure you'd never be
picked up, except by someone like
Pete, who would see in you a
salable item, even though not a
usable one. It may be, Pete, that
you have saved the world."</p>

<p>So, that's the story. We're all
still on the Road, of course, but
now we are the "Commission for
the Investigation of Extraterrestrial
Invasion." Congress named
us as that, when we got the data
to them.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Mayor, you see our
problem. Have your citizens seen
anything around that they don't
want? If they have, we want to
look at it.</p>
